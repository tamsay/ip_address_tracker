# IP Address Tracker

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f0dbdc5a-09de-48f0-a6af-780d7bfc325b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tamsay-ip-address-tracker/deploys)

### Welcome! üëã


This App helps to display some key details about IP addresses. Users are able to do the following with the app:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

I made use of [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) to get the IP Address details while [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) was used to display the map.

The project was created using vanilla js, html, css and bootstrap.
